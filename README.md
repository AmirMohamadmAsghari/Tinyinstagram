# Tinyinstagram

Tinyinstagram is a small example of an Instagram-like platform built using Django. This project is designed as a learning exercise and showcases the basic functionalities of a social media platform. Tinyinstagram allows users to create accounts, share posts, like and comment on posts, and interact with other users.

This project serves as my first experience with Django and web development.
